				<h2>HTML</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
					<li>
						The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
					</li>
					<li>
						The header HTML element represents introductory content, typically a
						group of introductory or navigational aids.
					</li>
					<li>
						The section HTML element represents a generic standalone section of
						a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to
						represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few
						exceptions.
					</li>
					<li>
						The div HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It
						has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way
						using CSS
					</li>
					<li>
						The span HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing
						content, which does not inherently represent anything.
					</li>
					<li>The img HTML element embeds an image into the document.</li>
					<li>
						The article HTML element represents a self-contained composition in
						a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be
						independently distributable or reusable.
					</li>
					<li>The p HTML element represents a paragraph.</li>
					<li>
						The footer HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor
						sectioning content or sectioning root element.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section class="card" id="css-section">
				<h2>CSS</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
						element.
					</li>
					<li>
						A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
						an element.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all
						of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas.
					</li>
					<li>
						An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css
						extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS
						to a document.
					</li>
					<li>A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content.</li>
					<li>CSS properties and values are case-insensitive.</li>
					<li>
						In 4-value shorthands like padding and margin, the values are
						applied in the order top, right, bottom, left (clockwise from the
						top).
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Git</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						By creating a branch, you create a space to work without affecting
						the default branch. Additionally, you give collaborators a chance to
						review your work.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake,
						you can revert your changes or push additional changes to fix the
						mistake. Your changes will not end up on the default branch until
						you merge your branch.
					</li>
					<li>
						Ideally, each commit contains an isolated, complete change. This
						makes it easy to revert your changes if you decide to take a
						different approach.
					</li>
					<li>
						Create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on your
						changes. Pull request review is so valuable that some repositories
						require an approving review before pull requests can be merged.
					</li>
					<li>
						When you create a pull request, include a summary of the changes and
						what problem they solve.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once your pull request is approved, merge your pull request. This
						will automatically merge your branch so that your changes appear on
						the default branch.
					</li>
					<li>
						After you merge your pull request, delete your branch. This
						indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you
						or others from accidentally using old branches.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section class="card" id="javascript-section">
				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by
						itself, or a variable that refers to the function.
					</li>
					<li>
						A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our
						code.
					</li>
					<li>
						Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
						script.
					</li>
					<li>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.</li>
					<li>
						There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do
						the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.
					</li>
					<li>
						A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
					</li>
					<li>
						JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different
						data types.
					</li>
					<li>
						JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is
						at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on
					</li>
